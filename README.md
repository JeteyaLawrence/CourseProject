Rock Paper Scissor Game 

When everyone were younger, you had to have played this game! 
It is the easist to learn and quickest to play. 
My course project will step through the code to execute the game rock, paper scissor.
So a kid no longer needs someone to play it with, they can play whenever they feel like it. 

In this code: 
The user will be click either choice of: Rock, Paper, Scissor. There will be a "computer" which will choose one at random using the random function. 

To run code pip install pygame and have images downloaded. 

Winning Rules: 
Rock vs Paper = Paper wins. 
Rock vs Scissor = Rock wins. 
Paper vs Scissor = Scissor Wins.
